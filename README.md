# Timescale Analysis of Local LIRGs and ULIRGs

This repository contains an analysis of the relevant physical timescales involved in high-energy neutrino production in local LIRGs and ULIRGs. 

This notebook explores various physical processes affecting cosmic rays, categorized into two main types:

- **Secondary particle-producing processes**: proton-proton (pp) interactions.
- **Non-secondary particle-producing processes**:
  - Spatial diffusion due to interactions of cosmic rays with magnetic fields.
  - Advection via large-scale galactic outflows.

The aim is to understand the competition between these processes and as such the efficiency of high-energy neutrino production. For the theoretical motivation supporting LIRGs as potential high-energy neutrino sources, see our work: Phys. Rev. D 108 (2023) 2, 023015 ([arXiv:2211.09972](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01020)).


The `Concistency_check` folder contains reference results and data from the literature, used to validate and compare the outcomes of the timescale analysis.
